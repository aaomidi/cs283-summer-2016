In this assignment we were supposed to write a program that takes an image and produces a picture using small thumbnails. These images are picked according to their average color.

With the use of the OpenCV library, we were able to achieve this goal.

In order to run the program:

```
make main
./h3wex INPUT.jpg 128 96 THUMBNAIL_DIR/*
```
